If you are frustrated with regular irrelevant messages from relatives, this app is what you need.  
With this app you can schedule messages so that you get notifications to send Good Morning, Good Evening etc (with images/videos).

For recurring events, the app sequentially picks the images from specified folder, so that images are not repeated so often (as with case of random selection). The current sequence number and max images are shown next to the event.

Code is written using Ionic Framework.
